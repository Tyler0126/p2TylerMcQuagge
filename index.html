	<h1>HCI Project 2 Tyler McQuagge</h1>

	<p>In this section I will go over 5 different car dashboards and list the pros and cons of each of them.</p>

	<h4>1: 2015 Honda Accord</h4>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/3D_Models/master/2015-Honda-Accord-Coupe-Dash.jpg" alt="dash" style="width:900px;height:500px;">

	<p>Pros:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Aesthetically pleasing</li>
		<li>Simple Design</li>
		<li>Cruise control is easy to use and access</li>
		<li>Able to navigate menu from steering wheel</li>
		<li>Every related item is grouped together (For example, speedometer/tachometer right next to eachother)</li>
		<li>Music volume control is placed directly next to radio screen.</li>
		<li>Engine Start/Stop button is placed in a convenient location</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Cons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Two digital screens in center are redundant and distracting</li>
		<li>Turn signal/windshield wiper controls look confusing</li>
		<li>Way too much clutter going on in the middle</li>
		<li>Speedomoter goes too high up</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>2: 2016 Nissan Altima</h4>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/3D_Models/master/2016-Nissan-Altima-dash.jpg" alt="dash" style="width:900px;height:500px;">

	<p>Pros:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Center is a lot less cluttered and it is very appealing. Looks easy to use.</li>
		<li>Speedometer and tachometer are placed in a convenient spot and are grouped together nicely</li>
		<li>Buttons on steering wheel allow the driver to have easier and safer access to more features while driving</li>
		<li>Simple and neutral color design make the dash much less distracting and more visually appealing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Cons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Speedometer goes too high up</li>
		<li>No push start button which is outdated for a 2016 model car</li>
		<li>Does not include dual air conditioning controls on dash</li>
		<li>Very minimalist and basic design which could come across as cheap</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>3: 2020 Mustang</h4>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/3D_Models/master/2020MustangDash.jpg" alt="dash" style="width:900px;height:500px;">

	<p>Pros:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Single digital screen is a compact design idea that makes for easy use</li>
		<li>3 A/C vents in the middle create a good air circulation</li>
		<li>Speedometer and Tachometer being seperated but still close together makes it easier to differentiate between the two</li>
		<li>Majority of buttons are grouped together in the middle which is a smart move from a design perspective</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Cons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Too many buttons on the left and right of the radio screen are distracting</li>
		<li>Radio preset buttons could come across as outdated</li>
		<li>Carbon fiber texture on dash could be percieved as masculine and not appealing to women</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>4: 2009 Mini Cooper</h4>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/3D_Models/master/2009MiniCooperDash.jpg" alt="dash" style="width:900px;height:500px;">
	<p>Pros:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Unique design does not look like any other car's dashboard</li>
		<li>Few buttons provides simplicity in use</li>
		<li>Speedomoter is large and easy to read</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Cons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Speedometer being in the middle causes the driver to have to divert their attention away from directly in front of them</li>
		<li>Speedometer and tachometer being so far away from eachother is a poor design decision</li>
		<li>Radio controls being in the speedometer is a poor design decision because these two things are not related to eachother and should be seperated</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>5: Mercedes Benz SLS-AMG</h4>

	<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tyler0126/3D_Models/master/mercedes-benz-sls-amg-dashboard.jpg" alt="dash" style="width:900px;height:500px;">
	<p>Pros:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Very simplistic and easy to understand dashboard, not confusing at all.</li>
		<li>The layout of the digital screen in the middle of the speedometer and tachometer is good and everything that is related to eachother is closely placed</li>
		<li>Also having a digital speed shown in addition to the speedometer showing the speed makes it easier on the user to quickly gauge how fast they are going</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Cons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The lights at the top of the dash are not labeled with anything, so it is confusing as to what the purpose of these are</li>
		<li>Having the gas meter in the speedometer and the engine temperature meter in the tachometer looks out of place. They should be seperated</li>
		<li>There is also no room for any warning lights so I am not sure how the driver will know when something is wrong.</li>
	</ul>

	<p></p>
	<h3>My most common features of car dashboards:</h3>
	<p>My most common use cases of car dashboards are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Gauge how fast I am going</li>
		<li>Set cruise control</li>
		<li>Check fuel level</li>
		<li>Look at the time</li>
		<li>Play music</li>
		<li>Use the turn signal</li>
		<li>Configure the air conditioning</li>
	</ul>

	<p>More rare use cases of car dashboards:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Check tire pressure</li>
		<li>Change clock time</li>
		<li>Monitor engine temperature</li>
		<li>Check odometer</li>
		<li>Look at warning lights when they come on (check engine light, low tire pressure light, traction control light)</li>
		<li>Honk the horn</li>
		<li>Navigate menus with steering wheel buttons</li>
	</ul>

	<p></p>
	<h3>Controls a user interacts with on car dashboards:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Cruise control</li>
		<li>Air conditioning butons</li>
		<li>Air conditioner temperature dial</li>
		<li>Horn</li>
		<li>Menu navigation on steering wheel</li>
		<li>Radio buttons</li>
		<li>Radio volume dial</li>
		<li>Hazards light button</li>
		<li>Windshield wiper switch</li>
		<li>Turn signal switch</li>
	</ul>

	<p></p>
	<h3>Common Mistakes:</h3>
	<p>There are many common mistakes that I make when using the current typical design of car dashboards. The first mistake I make a lot that comes to mind is that because most of the time the turn signal switch also has the windshield wiper controls on it, sometimes I will accidentally turn my windshield wipers on when using my turn signal.</p>

	<p>Another common mistake I make a lot is that if there is a temperature control dial and a radio volume dial that are the same size and look the same, then I will sometimes mix these dials up and use the wrong one.</p>

	<p>Another issue I run into is that it is sometimes hard to find the hazard lights button. Often in cars it is completely off by themselves in a hard to find location.</p>

	<p>Another mistake I ran into when I first started driving was that I had a hard time remembering and knowing what each warning light meant.</p>

	<p></p>
	<h3>Improvements:</h3>
	<p>With these mistakes in mind, there are some improvements I would make on the control interface. First, I would seperate the windshield controls from the turn signal switch. These do not need to be integrated into eachother because they serve two completely different purposes.</p>

	<p>Next, I would always make sure to never have the volume up dial and the temperature control dial be identical in look and size. This would help with confusion between the two dials, especially when trying to use them while driving and not looking at the dials.</p>

	<p>Next, I would make sure to always place the hazard lights button somewhere that was easy to see. A lot of time this button is used in emergency situations, and it makes no sense to be off in some discrete spot</p>

	<p>Finally, I would make it to where instead of displaying a symbol for all the warning lights, I would just display a message to avoid confusion for new drivers. For example, instead of the check engine light symbol showing up, I would simply have the dashboard display a light that said "Check Engine".</p>
